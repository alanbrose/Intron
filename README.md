# Intron
Code for analyzing introns
The Asymmetry code is for comparing the degree to which the frequency of kmers is different in promoter proximal and promoter distal introns. It calculates the frequency of occurence of all possible kmers of a specified length in introns less than a specified threshold from the start of transcription, and in introns more than that threshold from the start of transcription. It then sums the absolute value of the difference in frequency for each kmer in the two populations of introns. The resulting value can be between 0 (if all kmers appear with identical frequency in both populations) and 2 (if all kmers are found exclusively in one population or the other). To run this code, you will need a fasta file containing the sequences of all the introns in an organism and the distance between the start of the intron and the start of transcription.
